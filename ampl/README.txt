This folder holds the files needed for solving the child-snack problem with Linear Programming using AMPL and the CPLEX solver.

How to run:

* Use AMPL. Open ampl in this directory. (Tested with AMPL IDE, Version: 3.6.0.201909251254, OS: Windows 10, v.10.0, x86_64 / win32, Java version: 1.8.0_211)

* Make sure that your version of AMPL has CPLEX solver and license. (tested with version 12.9)

* When you have done that, do the following for each file in the same order:

* Send "child-snack.mod" to AMPL (right click on the file and select that option)

* Send "child-snack.dat" to AMPL 

* Send "child-snack.run" to AMPL

* Don't forget to reset the console after each run.
