# DD2380 Artificial Intelligence Project
Final project (for grade A) from the master course in Artificial Intelligence on KTH, fall 2019. <br/>
The child snack planning problem (stated below) was formulated and solved with two different approaches: Logical optimization & PDDL.

## Child Snack Problem Formulation
“The task is to plan how to make and serve sandwiches for a group of children in which some are allergic to gluten. There are two actions for making sandwiches from their ingredients. The first one makes a sandwich and the second one makes a sandwich taking into account that all ingredients are gluten-free. There are also actions to put a sandwich on a tray and to serve sandwiches.
Problems in this domain define the ingredients to make sandwiches at the initial state. Goals consist of having all kids served with a sandwich to which they are not allergic.“


### Tools
